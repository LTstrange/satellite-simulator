# Roadmap

Recording planned and future tasks.

- Cache data to mitigate speed differences between simulator and Python code. (may not be necessary)
- Implement a kind of double-pass connection for ISL simulation. (and set it as the default)
- Maintain simulator operation when window is minimized.
- Enhance netcode robustness. (May be just use bevy remote protocol is better)
- Resolve performance issues caused by gizmos.
