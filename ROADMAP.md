# Roadmap

Recording planned and future tasks.

- Cache data to mitigate speed differences between simulator and Python code. (may not be necessary)
- Implement a kind of double-pass connection for ISL simulation.
- Maintain simulator operation when window is minimized.
- Enhance netcode robustness.
- Resolve performance issues caused by gizmos.
